Hi there, I'm Andrei Clapa ğŸ‘‹
 
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Endava as Automation Tester 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about Automation Testing, JAVA and JavaScript
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to develop my skills as Automation Tester on JAVA projects but I'm also interested to work on the development side.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I am happy to help
âš¡ Fun fact: I like to learn new things, I like to challenge myself and I really like guitar
